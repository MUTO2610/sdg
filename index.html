    <h2 class="" id="work">How does this Work?</h2>
    <p class="p">This Model works on the concept of Electricty generation by 3 common resources available to us- Wind, Water and
      Solar(Sunlight). The windmill generate the most amount of energy, but it is the least efficient. The solar
      panels
      are the most efficient and produce the most energy. The water turbines are the least efficient and produce the
      least amount of energy. The idea is to use these resources for generation of energy sustainably without harming
      the environment. All the energy generated is transmitted to the central power grid which stores the energy and
      according to need forwards it to the transmission tower which carries it forward to the city and usage areas.
      The
      extra energy generated is stored in the batteries which is connected to the central power grid.</p>

    <p id="wind"></p>
    <h2 class="" id="w">Wind Resource</h2>
    <p class="p">Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity. Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity.</p>
    <h4>Advantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">Clean fuel source
      Zero carbon emissions
      Use only a fraction of land
      Don't depend on the combustion of fossil fuels
      Don't pollute the air like a power plant
      Wind energy is free</p>
    <h4>Disadvantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">It is not a continual energy source.
      It produces noise pollution.
      It also produces visual pollution.
      Birds have been killed by flying into rotational turbine blades.
      The travel and maintenance cost of turbines increases.
      It is time-consuming.</p>

    <h2 class="" id="hydro">Hydropower</h2>
    <p class="p">A conventional dam holds water in a man-made lake, or reservoir, behind it. When water is released through the dam, it spins a turbine connected to a generator that produces electricity.</p>
    <h4>Advantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">Hydropower is a renewable source of energy. 
      Hydropower is fueled by water, making it a clean source of energy.
      Hydroelectric power is a domestic source of energy, allowing each state to produce its own energy without being reliant on international fuel sources.
      Impoundment hydropower creates reservoirs that offer recreational opportunities such as fishing, swimming, and boating</p>
    <h4>Disadvantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">Environmental consequences The construction of hydroelectric power plants requires the creation of large dams, which can alter the natural flow of the river or stream water, leading to serious environmental consequences.
      High capital costs 
      Dependence on specific conditions
      Difficulty in maintenance 
      Geographical constraints</p>

  <div class="info">
    <h2 class="" id="s">Solar Resource</h2>
    <p class="p">When the sun shines onto a solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel. This energy creates electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell, causing electricity to flow.</p>
    <h4>Advantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">Energy savings
      Increased home value
      Environmental benefits (lower carbon footprint, reduced air pollution)
      Long-term savings
      Renewable energy source
      Tax incentives
      Low maintenance and upkeep costs
      Energy independence (when paired with solar battery systems)</p>
    <h4>Disadvantages-</h4>
    <p class="p">High upfront cost
      Environmental impact during manufacturing
      Limited recycling programs
      Impact on surrounding area during installation
      Intermittent energy source
      Potential increase in property taxes and homeowners insurance
      Dependence on sunlight
      Specific roof requirements
      Storage costs.</p>

  <h1 id="use">Solar at Homes</h2>
  <h2 class="sub">Why only Solar?</h2>
  <p>The most practical use is of solar as it takes up less area for installation that is it can be installed even at homes, offices etc. many companies such as RENCO provide complete installation resulting in reduce electricty bills.
    It is the only practial method as other resources- wind and water which require big systems- windmill and hydropower generator cannot be installed easily, require lot of maintenance, space and money. Though solar systems are not that cheap they are a one time investment harvesting a lot of profit. </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="sub">Requirement/Cost</h2>
  <p class="txt">
  Area- 50-60sqft for 1kW solar plant
  Costing- Cost starts from 30000 per kW
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="sub">Result</h2>
  <p class="txt">Best for cost cutting of electricity especially when usage is high.</p>
  <p class="txt">
    1kw plant generates approx 5-6 units electricity per day.</p>
    <p>Cost is reduced accordingly to the area.
